A collection of some of my favorites

- PDF Arranger - https://github.com/pdfarranger/pdfarranger : It's surprisingly hard to find a good free PDF editor for splitting/merging/rotating PDFs. This one with open source and cross-platform.
- Photopea  - https://www.photopea.com/ : Free online Photoshop alternative
- Trello: Task management (i.e. To-do lists)
- Anylist : Shopping list manager
- Keepass : Password management. Use your own service (e.g. Google Drive) to sync the database.
- https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg : Allows opening any video in a PiP window
